I started exploring Tailwind CSS and decided to port one of my favorite CSS codepen in it. I wanted to see what the learning curve looks like and how tailwind actually helps in code management and future maintenance.

The Code repo and stackblitz links:
* https://github.com/ranuzz/tailwind-css-bubble-port
* https://stackblitz.com/github/ranuzz/tailwind-css-bubble-port

The component I picked is an animated CSS sphere that looks like a bubble. The whole process with progression is explained in this post [`https://cssanimation.rocks/spheres/`](https://cssanimation.rocks/spheres/)

The codepen for the version that I'm panning to port.
